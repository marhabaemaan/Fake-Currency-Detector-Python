# Fake Currency Detection Using Digital Image Processing

"Detecting Fake Pakistani Currency Notes" is a Python project utilizing digital image processing techniques to discern counterfeit notes. With a dataset comprising 70 test images of fake notes, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained to differentiate between genuine and counterfeit currency. Leveraging Python's libraries for image processing and machine learning, the project employs feature extraction and classification algorithms to analyze intricate patterns and security features embedded in banknotes.
